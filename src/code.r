# Follow the seven steps from the [tutorial](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/anova-in-r/). Please add the code from each step below. When you are finished, you should be able to run your code without errors appearing. For each step, please provide two sentences in _clear and meaningful language_ to describe what the code is doing.
